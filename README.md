## Overview

Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions,
that sorts the integers received as arguments.

### The project

- This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection,
  but it will also allow you to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming:
  static variables.
